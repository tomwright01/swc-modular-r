## Analyzing Multiple Data Sets

We have created a function called `analyze` that creates graphs of the minimum, average, and maximum daily inflammation rates for a single data set:

```{r inflammation-01}
analyze <- function(filename) {
  # Plots the average, min, and max inflammation over time.
  # Input is character string of a csv file.
  dat <- read.csv(file = filename, header = FALSE)
  avg_day_inflammation <- apply(dat, 2, mean)
  plot(avg_day_inflammation)
  max_day_inflammation <- apply(dat, 2, min)
  plot(max_day_inflammation)
  min_day_inflammation <- apply(dat, 2, max)
  plot(min_day_inflammation)
}
      
analyze("inflammation-01.csv")
```

We can use it to analyze other data sets one by one:

```{r inflammation-02}
analyze("inflammation-02.csv")
```

but we have a dozen data sets right now and more on the way.
We want to create plots for all our data sets with a single statement.
To do that, we'll have to teach the computer how to repeat things.

#### Objectives

* Explain what a `for` loop does.
* Correctly write `for` loops to repeat simple calculations.
* Trace changes to a loop variable as the loop runs.
* Trace changes to other variables as they are updated by a for loop.
* Explain what a list is.
* Create and index lists of simple values.
* Use a function to get a list of filenames that match a simple wildcard pattern.
* Use a `for` loop to process multiple files.

### For Loops

Suppose we want to print each word in a sentence.
One way is to use six `print` statements:

```{r}
best_practice <- c("Let", "the", "computer", "do", "the", "work")
print_words <- function(sentence) {
  print(sentence[1])
  print(sentence[2])
  print(sentence[3])
  print(sentence[4])
  print(sentence[5])
  print(sentence[6])
}

print_words(best_practice)
```

but that's a bad approach for two reasons:

 1. It doesn't scale: if we want to print the elements in a vector that's hundreds long, we'd be better off just typing them in.

 2. It's fragile: if we give it a longer vector, it only prints part of the data, and if we give it a shorter input, it returns `NA` values because we're asking for elements that don't exist!

```{r}
best_practice[-6]
print_words(best_practice[-6])
```

> **Tip:** R has has a special variable, `NA`, for designating **M**issing **V**alues in a data set.
See `?NA` and [An Introduction to R][na] for more details.

[na]: http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.html#Missing-values

Here's a better approach:

```{r}
print_words <- function(sentence) {
  for (word in sentence) {
    print(word)
  }
}

print_words(best_practice)
```

This is shorter---certainly shorter than something that prints every character in a hundred-letter string---and more robust as well:

```{r}
print_words(best_practice[-6])
```

The improved version of `print_words` uses a [for loop](../../gloss.html#for-loop) to repeat an operation---in this case, printing---once for each thing in a collection.
The general form of a loop is:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
for (variable in collection) {
    do things with variable
}
```

We can name the [loop variable](../../gloss.html#loop-variable) anything we like (with a few [restrictions][], e.g. the name of the variable cannot start with a digit).
`in` is part of the `for` syntax.
Note that the body of the loop is enclosed in braces `{`.
For a single-line loop body, as here, the braces aren't needed, but it is good practice to include them as we did.

[restrictions]: http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-intro.html#R-commands_003b-case-sensitivity-etc

Here's another loop that repeatedly updates a variable:

```{r}
len <- 0
vowels <- c("a", "e", "i", "o", "u")
for (v in vowels) {
    len <- len + 1
}
# Number of vowels
len
```

It's worth tracing the execution of this little program step by step.
Since there are five elements in the vector `vowels`, the statement inside the loop will be executed five times.
The first time around, `len` is zero (the value assigned to it on line 1) and `v` is `"a"`.
The statement adds 1 to the old value of `len`, producing 1, and updates `len` to refer to that new value.
The next time around, `v` is `"e"` and `len` is 1, so `len` is updated to be 2.
After three more updates, `len` is 5; since there is nothing left in the vector `vowels` for R to process, the loop finishes.

Note that a loop variable is just a variable that's being used to record progress in a loop.
It still exists after the loop is over, and we can re-use variables previously defined as loop variables as well:

```{r}
letter <- "z"
for (letter in c("a", "b", "c")) {
  print(letter)
}
# after the loop, letter is
letter
```

Note also that finding the length of a vector is such a common operation that R actually has a built-in function to do it called `length`:

```{r}
length(vowels)
```

`length` is much faster than any R function we could write ourselves, and much easier to read than a two-line loop; it will also give us the length of many other things that we haven't met yet, so we should always use it when we can (see this [lesson](00-first-timers.html) to learn more about the different ways to store data in R).

#### Challenges

1. R has a built-in function called `seq` that creates a list of numbers:

```{r}
seq(3)
```

Using `seq`, write a function that prints the **N** natural numbers, one per line:

```{r include=FALSE}
print_N <- function(N) {
  nseq <- seq(N)
  for (num in nseq) {
    print(num)
  }
}
```

```{r}
print_N(3)
```

2. Exponentiation is built into R:

```{r}
2^4
```

Write a function called `expo` that uses a loop to calculate the same result.

```{r include=FALSE}
expo <- function(base, power) {
  result <- 1
  for (i in seq(power)) {
    result <- result * base
  }
  return(result)
}
```

```{r}
expo(2, 4)
```

3. We can also apply some simple methods to R vectors. One of these is called `sort`. It works on numbers or letters: 

```{r}
sort(words)
sort(words, decreasing = TRUE)
```

Write a function called `rsort` that does the same thing. <!-- This seems an odd thing to ask in a section on for loops -->

#### Ch-Ch-Ch-Changes

Data that can be changed is called *mutable*, while data that cannot be is called *immutable*. Like strings, numbers are immutable: there's no way to make the number 0 have the value 1 or vice versa (at least, not in R---there actually are languages that will let people do this, with predictably confusing results). Vectors, data frames, and matrices, on the other hand, are mutable: they can be modified after they have been created.

Programs that modify data in place can be harder to understand than ones that don't because readers may have to mentally sum up many lines of code in order to figure out what the value of something actually is. On the other hand, programs that modify data in place instead of creating copies that are almost identical to the original every time they want to make a small change are much more efficient.
There are many ways to change the contents besides assigning to elements:

```{r}
odds <- c(1,3,5,7,9)
odds <- append(odds, 13)
odds <- odds + 1
odds <- odds[-1]
odds <- sort(odds, decreasing = TRUE)
```

#### Challenges

1. Write a function called total that calculates the sum of the values in a vector. (R has a built-in function called `sum` that does this for you. Please don't use it for this exercise.)

```{r}
total <- function(vector) {
	#calculates the sum of the values in a vector
	sum <- 0
	for (i in seq_along(vector)) {
		sum <- sum + vector[i]
	}
	sum
}
```

### Processing Multiple Files

We now have almost everything we need to process all our data files. 

What we need is a function that finds files whose names match a pattern. We provide those patterns as strings: the character `*` matches zero or more characters, while `?` matches any one character. We can use this to get the names of all the R files we have created so far:

```{r}
list.files(pattern = "*.R")
```

or to get the names of all our `.csv` data files:

```{r}
list.files(path = "./data", pattern="*.csv", recursive = TRUE)
```

As these examples show, `list.files` result is a list of strings, which means we can loop over it to do *something* with each filename in turn. In our case, the *something* we want is our `analyze` function. Let's test it by analyzing the first three files in the list:

```{r, fig=FALSE}
filenames <- list.files(path = "./data", pattern = "*.csv", recursive = TRUE)[1:3]

for (f in seq_along(filenames)) {
    print(filenames[f])
    analyze(file.path("data", filenames[f]))
}
```

Sure enough, the maxima of these data sets show exactly the same ramp as the first, and their minima show the same staircase structure.

#### Challenges

1. Write a function called `analyze_all` that takes a filename pattern as its sole argument and runs analyze for each file whose name matches the pattern.

### To loop or not to loop...?
Intro sentence
#### Vectorized operations
A key difference between R and many other languages is a topic known as *vectorization*. When you wrote the `total` function, we mentioned that R already has `sum` to do this; `sum` is *much* faster than the interpreted `for` loop because `sum` is coded in C to work with a vector of numbers. Many of R's functions work this way; the loop is hidden from you in C.
Learning to use vectorized operations is a key skill in R.

For example, to add pairs of numbers contained in two vectors
```{r}
a <- 1:10
b <- 1:10
```
you could loop over the pairs adding each in turn, but that would be very inefficient in R
```{r}
res <- numeric(length = length(a))
for (i in seq_along(a)) {
    res[i] <- a[i] + b[i]
}
res
```
Instead, `+` is a *vectorized* function which can operate on entire vectors at once
```{r}
res2 <- a + b
all.equal(res, res2)
```

#### `for` or `apply`?
A `for` loop is used to apply the same function calls to a collection of objects.
R has a family of function, the `apply` family, which can be used in much the same way. You've already used one of the family, `apply` in lesson *01 Starting with data*.
The `apply` family members include

 * `apply`  - apply over the margins of an array (e.g. the rows or columns of a matrix)
 * `lapply` - apply over an object and return list
 * `sapply` - apply over an object and return a simplified object (an array) if possible
 * `vapply` - similar to `sapply` but you specify the type of object returned by the iterations

Each of these has an argument `FUN` which takes a function to apply to each element of the object. Instead of looping over `filenames` and calling `analyze`, as you did earlier, you could `sapply` over `filenames` with `FUN = analyze`

```{r, fig=FALSE}
sapply(filenames, FUN = analyze)
```

Deciding whether to use `for` or one of the `apply` family is really personal preference. Using an `apply` family function forces to you encapsulate your operations as a function rather than separate calls with `for`. `for` loops are often more natural in some circumstances; for several related operations, a `for` loop will avoid you having to pass in a lot of extra arguments to your function.

#### Loops in R are slow
No, they are not! *If* you follow some golden rules.

 1. Don't use a loop when a vectorised alternative exists
 2. Don't grow objects (via `c`, `cbind`, etc) during the loop - R has to create a new object and copy across the information just to add a new element or row/column
 3. Allocate an object to hold the results and fill it in during the loop

As an example, we'll create a new version of `analyze` that will return the minimum, maximum, and mean of the data from a file.

```{r, results="markup"}
analyze2 <- function(filenames) {
    for (f in seq_along(filenames)) {
        fdata <- read.csv(file.path("data", filenames[f]), header = FALSE)
        res <- apply(fdata, 2, mean)
        if (f == 1) {
           out <- res
        } else {
            out <- cbind(out, res)
        }
    }
    out
}

system.time(avg2 <- analyze2(filenames))
```

Note how we add a new column to `out` at each iteration? This is a cardinal sin of writing a `for` loop in R.

Instead, we can create an empty matrix with the right dimensions (rows/columns) to hold the results.
Then we loop over the files but this time we fill in the `f`th column of our results matrix `out`.
This time there is no copying/growing for R to deal with.

```{r, results="markup"}
analyze3 <- function(filenames) {
    out <- matrix(ncol = length(filenames), nrow = 40) ## assuming 40 here from files 
    for (f in seq_along(filenames)) {
        fdata <- read.csv(file.path("data", filenames[f]), header = FALSE)
        out[, f] <- apply(fdata, 2, mean)
    }
    out
}

system.time(avg3 <- analyze3(filenames))
```
In this simple example there is little difference in the compute time of `analyze2` and `analyze3`. This is because we are only iterating over 3 files and hence we only incur 3 copy/grow operations. If we were doing this over more files or the data objects we were growing were larger, the penalty for copying/growing would be much larger.

Note that `apply` handles these memory allocation issues for you, but then you have to write the loop part as a function to pass to `apply`. At its heart, `apply` is just a `for` loop with extra convenience.

#### Key Points

* Use `for (variable in collection)` to process the elements of a collection one at a time.
* The body of a for loop does not have to be indented, but should be for clarity.
* Use `length(thing)` to determine the length of something that contains other values.
* `c(value1, value2, value3`) creates a vector
* Vectors are indexed and sliced in the same way as strings and arrays.
* vectors are mutable (i.e., their values can be changed in place).
* Use `list.files(pattern)` to create a list of files whose names match a pattern.
* Use `*` in a pattern to match zero or more characters.


#### Next Steps

We have now solved our original problem: we can analyze any number of data files with a single command. More importantly, we have met two of the most important ideas in programming:

* Use functions to make code easier to re-use and easier to understand.
* Use vectors and arrays to store related values, and loops to repeat operations on them.

We have one more big idea to introduce...
