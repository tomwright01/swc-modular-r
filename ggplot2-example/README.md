title: Data visualization with ggplot2
level: misc
---

This lesson contains an Rmd file with code and documentation for a quick introduction to the `ggplot2` package for data visualization. Upon completing this lesson, learners will be able to use ggplot2 to explore high-dimensional data by faceting and scaling scatter plots in small multiples.

The lesson should take approximately 10 minutes for instruction, and another 5 minutes for an exercise at the end using a different dataset. Learners should already have a basic introduction to R, including:

* Installing and loading packages
* Loading built-in data with the `data()` function
* Inspecting data frames with `head()`, `str()`, etc.
* Basic plotting using base graphics

---

To Do: 

* Expand lesson to ggplot2 philosophy, using `ggplot` instead of `qplot`
* Populate the exercise under the `qplot` section.
